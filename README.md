## Kmeans_cluster.py

Performs scikit learn's Kmeans cluster algorithm on mixture data

Data generated using np.random.rand() about 3 center values [1,1] , [2,1] , and [2,2]

File runs without inputs

Prints predicted centers based on cluster algorithm

Produces plot of data mixture labeled by cluster: KMeans_3cluster.png
